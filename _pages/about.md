I'm a junior undergraduate student from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring electronic information engineering. Currently, I'm a visiting student at ENCODE Lab, Westlake University, working with [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/)

My research focuses on Computer Vision, Efficient AI, and Machine Learning Systems (MLSys), with an emphasis on innovative model compression and acceleration techniques. I aim to design resource-efficient AI systems that bridge the gap between academic innovation and practical deployment.
